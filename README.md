## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

My biggest challenge this time was one I set for myself. I never liked the look of the standard attribution at the bottom, so I used to delete it. However, since I really appreciate Frontend Mentor, I felt like I was disrespecting them by doing so. To fix that, I implemented a small button instead, which I plan to use as long as it fits the design.

Ironically, this little detail ended up causing me more frustration than the entire project ^^

### Continued development

I want to strengthen my understanding of semantic HTML and work on making my styles more responsive.
